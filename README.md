#### Still trying to automate things, So I have more time to touch grass ! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ±

Script is working fine for now.  

set up a `GitHub token` ðŸ”‘ and save it to an env variable or a GitHub secret before running anything.  

if you are running locally ðŸ’» **hardcode** it on the script file ðŸ“œ or save it on an `.env` file.


currently working on documentation ðŸ“„  
I will further explain in here soon.
